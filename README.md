# HolovisApp
Trying out some Unity / Hololens development.
## Local Development
1. Clone the repo
2. Build the project in Unity
3. Deploy to the hardware (or the Hololens emulator).
## How to use
Once deployed, just start gazing at the letters and see what they do. If you want to start over, air tap any of the letters.
